<textarea id="source" style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" rows="10">Although the distributional hypothesis \textit{"words that occur in similar contexts, tend to have similar meanings"} is commonly traced back to \newcite{harris1954distributional}, according to \newcite{sahlgren2006word}, theoretical foundations of his distributional methodology go back to structuralist linguist Bloomfield (1887 - 1949) and Ferdinand de Saussure (1857 - 1913). \newcite{de2011course} pointed out that there can be distinctive functional roles of \textit{signs} within the language system. He defined functional differences of linguistic elements in two (orthogonal) types which are widely studied with distributional relations in distributional semantics (DS) research today: \textit{syntagmatic} and \textit{paradigmatic}. Briefly, "words have a syntagmatic relation if they co-occur, and a paradigmatic relation if they share same neighbors" \cite{sahlgren2006word}. Paradigmatic words represent similar concepts or entities of the real world which are most likely substitutional in the context. One example is the synonyms like "clever" and "smart" in the sentence "She is very [clever | smart]." where two words are less likely to occur at the same sentence.
